        On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to
        coordinate with the overall look of your document. You can use these
        galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and
        other document building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or
        diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look. You can
        easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text by
        choosing a look for the selected text from the Quick Styles gallery on
        the Home tab. You can also format text directly by using the other
        controls on the Home tab. Most controls offer a choice of using the look
        from the current theme or using a format that you specify directly. To
        change the overall look of your document, choose new Theme elements on
        the Page Layout tab. To change the looks available in the Quick Style
        gallery, use the Change Current Quick Style Set command. Both the Themes
        gallery and the Quick Styles gallery provide reset commands so that you
        can always restore the look of your document to the original contained
        in your current template. On the Insert tab, the galleries include items
        that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of your document.
        You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists,
        cover pages, and other document building blocks. When you create
        pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with your current
        document look.
